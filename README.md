# K-nearest_neighbors

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the K nearest data points to a given input and using their labels to predict the label for the input.

This code will perform KNN classification on a set of training data points with two features (x and y) and labels of 0 or 1. It will calculate the Euclidean distance between the input point and each of the training data points, and then predict the label for the input point as the label with the most occurrences among the K nearest neighbors (in this case, K = 3).
